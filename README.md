## Overview

The **[Work Motivation ‚Äì Pairwise Ranking](https://motivation-paires.streamlit.app)** app is an interactive tool built with **Streamlit**.  
It helps identify your **main sources of professional motivation** by comparing statements two at a time.

Each comparison contributes to a **personalized ranking** and a **category-based motivation score**.

  - Stability / Routine / Security  
  - Variety / Novelty

  - Autonomy  

- **Pairwise comparison algorithm**: users select which statement matters most to them.

## Methodology

This test is based on theories of **intrinsic and extrinsic motivation**, drawing from **McClelland** and **Deci & Ryan**.

- Each statement receives a linear weight (35 points for rank 1, 1 point for rank 35).  
- **Category score** = sum of the 5 questions in each category, normalized by the theoretical maximum (35+34+33+32+31 = 165) √ó 100.  
- Results are expressed as percentages and visualized with bar charts.

The purpose is to identify your **key motivational drivers** and understand what truly fuels your professional engagement.
